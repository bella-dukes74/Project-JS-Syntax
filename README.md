# Project-JS-Syntax
## This is my first official Codecademy Portfolio Project.
The purpose of this project is to take what I have learned thus far in Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Course to build a message generator program. Every time a user runs the program, they should get a new, randomized output (in this case: a math joke), which would demonstrate the **JavaScript** programming I have learned. Uploading the project to GitHub would demonstrate my knowledge of using the **terminal and other locally sourced developing programs** that I have learned.

After finishing project:
I added project to this folder after completely finishing it. I think I should have added it before then created branches to log commits. I know that now. I am still learning, but I will try that for next project.
